- modernize and clean-up the codebase
- drop Django <1.11 dependencies
- remove dependency on Sites framework
- fix unresolved issues
- update documentation (Sphinx + ReadTheDocs)
- create exhaustive (and automated) tests
- add new features

(For now) our progress can be tracked through issues. Feel free
